# BREL (better-releases)

## Context

brel is a tool to setup the better-releases workflow

## Development

When developing, make sure to use dex for task tracking and progress monitoring. If a task is too big, split it into subtasks. Make sure to reflect the step you're on with Dex (marking a task as in progress, blocked, etc) while you work (looking at dex should display the current state of the task you're working on)

Before considering a task is done (meaning your work for the session is completed), make sure that:
- Tests pass
- Clippy is ok
- Fmt is ok
